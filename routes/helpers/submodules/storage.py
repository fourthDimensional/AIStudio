# Write an interface that uses the S3_HOST and S3_PORT environment variables to manage, upload, and download files from an S3 bucket. The interface should include the following methods: upload_file, download_file, and list_files. The upload_file method should take a file path and upload the file to the S3 bucket. The download_file method should take a file name and download the file from the S3 bucket. The list_files method should return a list of all files in the S3 bucket.
# It must use the AWS API, with put/get requests.
